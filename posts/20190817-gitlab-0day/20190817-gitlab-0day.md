## On August 6 we discover a gitlab 12.0 vulnerarbility
* Due a critical intrusion on one of our friends gitlab servers we were able to discover a 0day vulnerability on Gitlab. This issue wasn't fix until a week ago in 12.04v
* Our upgrade policy is bleeding edgy. We try to get the latest version of every service as soon as it is realeased. We believe that all updates, especially the securityrelated ones are mandatory. Our commitment with the users is to provide the more secure infraestructure we can, and theoretically every version is more secure that the previous one. But in reality some versions comes with gruesome vulnerabilities, thats the case on gitlab 12.0. This version comes with a grafana service automaticly deployed and enabled, with admin admin credentials. This enable an intruder to enter the service and scalate priviles until the total control of the system (luckily).
* *IF* we would read the changelog there clearly said that this service was on and vulnerable. But we didn't read it. At least not so thorough. Anyway properly initial behavior should be desabled and not use admin admin as default credentials.
* After a short talk with  Gitlab.com team we were instructed how to disable the grafana service by default. We needed to add a parameter on the gitlab.rb config file
```
grafana['enable'] = false
```
