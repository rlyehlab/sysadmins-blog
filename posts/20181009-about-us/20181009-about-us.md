# It's All About Us

Hello there! If you are reading this, I bet you must be seriously bored.  
However, let me tell you that being a R'lyeh Sysadmin is all fun and games,
yeah! Sure! Sometimes it even implies staying up late coding and fixin 24hs
straight. No joke.

True story is, we love it. At R'lyeh, we try our best to provide our users with
the services they require. We take security and privacy seriously. We'll be
writing and signing a nice privacy policy soon, to celebrate the first year of
ur beloved hacklab, and also the first year where we are fully autonomous... Or
sort of, I mean. We have all of our ifrastructure at the lab, and we are proud
of that.  
In a week or so we'll be launching our warrant canary, even though here in Argentina
the don't seem to be very necessary. But you can never be too cautious.

## Work Hard, Play Hard

Well, we have an Urban Terror server too! But it's kinda a secret or so, I'm
not too sure.  
Besides that, we'll be writing interesting stuff here at our blog. Like the
time we wanted to use [Ceph](https://ceph.com/) in our Arch Linux server but
[ceph-deploy](https://github.com/ceph/ceph-deploy) didn't support Arch, so we
[implemented it](https://github.com/ceph/ceph-deploy/commits?author=HacKanCuBa).
We have many anecdotes we'd like to share, so we hope to remember them.
